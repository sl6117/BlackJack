#BlackJack
Welcome to my 2nd personal project. This is a single player game of Blackjack against Rerminal as the dealer.

##Description
1. The game has a few limitations at the moment. Due to my shortage on knowledge, the hierarchy between different suits (Diamonds, Spades), and hierarchy between different combinations of the same value aren't represented in this mini game. 
2. The deciding factor of victory will be the sum of the value of cards on hand. If both sides have the same value, it is a tie.
3. The dealer's first card is visible to the player. However, all cards will be invisible to the player afterwards.

##Instructions
1. Open the blackjack.py file on Terminal.
2. Have Fun ;)
